Cardiac arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity worldwide. This project explores deep 
learning approaches to automate ECG anomaly detection, focusing on Atrial Fibrillation (AF).
Cardiac arrhythmias are irregularities in the heartbeat that can result in severe health issues. 
Early detection is crucial to prevent complications like stroke or heart failure. Traditional 
diagnostic methods are time-consuming and prone to errors, necessitating automated solutions.
This project uses the INCART 2-lead Arrhythmia Dataset to train a deep learning model for 
real-time arrhythmia detection.
